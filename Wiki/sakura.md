Why would you embed a sakura leaf into your executable of the game? for what reason? Why can't it be like any other asset in a packed archive in one place? Who made you do this Leaf? The same goes for BGM, but I understand the ease of use of having a cd game where it can also function as a playlist in a cd reader.
